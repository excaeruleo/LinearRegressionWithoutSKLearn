# LinearRegressionWithoutSKLearn
Python project that does a linear regression of a set of data without sci-kit learn. The project mainly uses numpy to read the data, figure out the dimension of the data, create an array using only ones, concatenate the ones to X matrix, and create the y matrix. Matplotlib.pyplot is used to plot the data from the data file organized by numpy. Note the import of tkinter: this is to make sure that matplotlib is using the right back-end to graph the plots. If you are using a distribution system such as WSL or Ubuntu with a Python version that is not 3.9 or later, the plot of the data will not show. 

Another thing to note about utilizing matplotlib.pyplot is that whichever command you are using to run the program (e.g. python, python3, python3.10, etc), you must have matplotlib installed to that explicit version of python (e.g. if I use python3 LinearRegression.py to run this program, make sure you pip install matplotlib on python3 utilizing the command python3 -m pip install matplotlib). This is very important, as this has caused numerous ImportErrors of the matplotlib.py import statement for me.
